# Amazon-Price-Tracker

First launched in the 90s , Amazon is one of the most successful e-commerce website in existence today. With amazing deals, pricing and stellar deliveries, Amazon is the goto place for people willing to purchase items online. 

More often than not, prices of items vary on Amazon based on a variety of factors. At some periods of time, very high priced items on Amazon might be reduced to a very low price, and the time window for this drastically reduced price is extremely short, so consumers often miss the extremely amazing deal on a product in their wishlists. 

This project developed on python aims to derive data from Amazon website of the product that the user wants to track the price of. It utilises the smtp module in python to send emails to the user when the price of the item falls below the limit set by the user. 

# Working: 
To run the following code: 
Copy the following piece of code to install neccessary dependencies: 
```
pip install html smtplib bs4 requests
```

**Conclusion:** the project develops an integrated full stack system with a back end running on python and front-end running on email softwares and the Amazon Website. This is an extremely useful tool for users who never want to miss out on a great deal.
